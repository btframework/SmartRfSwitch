# Smart RF Switch
  **433Mhz RF Switch to HomeKit connection**
  
  Smart light bulbs, smart relays, and other “smart” devices in the home are cool. But! There's always that damn “but.” At 3 a.m., when everyone is asleep, yelling, “Hey Siri! Turn on the kitchen light” is not a good idea. And constantly reaching for your smartphone to turn something on or off is also not a good idea. You can, of course, put motion sensors in, but there are nuances with them. So you can't do without switches.

  My first impulse was to buy a switch that is compatible with my smart home system (and I have an Apple Home, mind you). I looked at what was on sale. First of all, most are from the Chinese and required their own application that somehow cleverly threw something there somewhere. Secondly, which is quite sad, most required a prepared wiring or ZigBee gateway, or both. In general, the option fell away for several reasons.

  The second thought (which comes later) was to buy any switch at all and wire it to the Apple Home via HomerBridge. This idea again ran into ZigBee hubs and wiring.

  Having given up on all this nonsense and racking my brains, I suddenly remembered that I'm a programmer. What should we do to make a switch ourselves? No problem. We take a radio relay and build it. I stalled on the fact that I was too lazy to print a normal switch button. So the idea was put aside in not a very long.

  So, not too long ago, I was looking for something online and decided to see what's out there in the smart switch technology realm. And I found a cool thing: a full-size switch with a relay on 433 MHz. And the main thing is that this switch (the button itself) works from a battery, and the relay is connected to the wires of the chandelier (or bulb). Thus, special wiring for it is not needed.

  > Let me make it clear: by “special wiring”, I mean phase and zero wiring to the light switch. That is, you should have three wires coming to the switch: phase from the switchboard (which is broken), phase to the chandelier, and zero from the switchboard. Usually, the standard wiring to the switch is just two wires: phase from the switchboard, and it goes to the chandelier (phase break). There is no zero there.

  Here is the switch.
